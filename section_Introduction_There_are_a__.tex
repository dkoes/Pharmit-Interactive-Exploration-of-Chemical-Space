\section{Introduction}

There are a multitude of software packages and web services that assist in computer aided drug design \cite{Villoutreix_2013}, but a relative paucity of services that support structure-based virtual screening.  Those that exist, such as DockBlaster \cite{Irwin_2009} and iDrug \cite{Wang_2014}, are typically batch-processing services where the user submits a virtual screening job and receives the results hours or days later.  Alternatively, advanced algorithms enable interactive time-scale searches, but existing web resources \cite{Koes_2012,Koes_2012z} are limited by a single search modality and a restricted search domain.  In contrast, Pharmit provides both pharmacophore and molecular shape search modalities as well as ranking results by energy minimization
