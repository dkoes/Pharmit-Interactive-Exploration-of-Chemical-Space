\section{Introduction}

There are a multitude of software packages and web services that assist in computer aided drug design \cite{Villoutreix_2013}, but a relative paucity of services that support structure-based virtual screening.  Those that exist, such as DockBlaster \cite{Irwin_2009} and iDrug \cite{Wang_2014}, are typically batch-processing services where the user submits a virtual screening job and receives the results hours or days later.
