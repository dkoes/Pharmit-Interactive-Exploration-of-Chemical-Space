Pharmacophore as primary query. Each pharmacophore feature has a collapsible menu where its type, location, and radius, as well as number of atoms (for hydrophobic features) or hydrogen bond direction and visibility (if relevant), can be defined. Filters may be set to reduce excessive hits, constraining the number of hits returned for a given conformer or molecule as well as the total number of hits. Selecting a hit in the results menu displays it, and its appearance can be adjusted in the visualization menu along with other aspects of the visual display. This example uses tyrosine-protein kinase c-Src (PDB ID: 2SRC).
