Pharmacophore as primary query. Each pharmacophore feature has a collapsible menu in the Pharmacophore panel (left) where its type, location, and radius, as well as number of atoms (for hydrophobic features) or directionality (if relevant) can be defined. Selected features are shown as solid spheres and unselected features as meshes. Filters may be set to reduce the number of hits by constraining the number of hits returned for a given conformer or molecule or the overall number of hits. Selecting a hit in the results panel (right) displays it, and its appearance can be adjusted in the visualization filter along with other aspects of the visual display.  For example, here the query ligand is shown in light gray, and the selected hit compound is shown in cyan. This query against tyrosine-protein kinase c-Src (PDB 2SRC) is available on the Pharmit Examples page.
