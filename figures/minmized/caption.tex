\label{minfig} (Left) An example of a pharmacophore-aligned hit for a query derived from PDB 2SRC against the DUDe 2SRC benchmarking dataset, and (Right) the same example after energy minimization. The group that is actually within the electrostatic surface of the protein in the pharmacophore-aligned pose rotates to fill the hydrophobic back pocket, resulting in an overall energy score of -9.05 kcal/mol.
