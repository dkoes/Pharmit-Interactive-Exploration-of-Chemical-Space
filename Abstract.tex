Pharmit (\url{http://pharmit.csb.pitt.edu}) provides an online, interactive environment for the virtual screening of large compound databases using pharmacophores, molecular shape, and energy minimization.  Users can import, create, and edit virtual screening queries in an interactive browser-based interface.  In addition to a number of pre-built databases of commercially available compounds, users may submit their own compound libraries for screening.  Pharmit uses state-of-the-art sub-linear algorithms to provide interactive screening (queries typically take a matter of seconds) of millions of compounds. This allows users to iteratively refine their search during a single session.
