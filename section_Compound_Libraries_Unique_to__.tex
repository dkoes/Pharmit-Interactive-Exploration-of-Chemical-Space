\section{Compound Libraries}

Unique to Pharmit is the ability to select from a number of provided compound libraries or to submit a custom library for screening.  The library to screen is selected through a pull down menu in the search button.  

\subsection{Provided Libraries}

Large libraries corresponding to compound catalogs from a variety of sources are provided and periodically updated to ensure continued relevance, especially with regard to compound availability from commercial sources.  Currently, Pharmit has pre-built libraries generated from CHEMBL20 \cite{Gaulton_2011}, with $>1.3$ million compounds; ChemDiv (\url{www.chemdiv.com}), with $>1.4$ million compounds; MolPort (\url{www.molport.com}), with $>6.5$ million compounds; the NCI Open Chemical Repository (\url{dtp.cancer.gov}), with $>125,000$ compounds; and PubChem \cite{Kim_2015}, with $>66$ million compounds. 
 Although a search is limited to the compounds of the selected library, all compounds within these provided libraries are cross-annotated so, for example, it is possible to look up the PubChem record of a compound found by searching the commercial MolPort library to check for known bioactivities.


\subsection{Library Creation}

Users may submit their own libraries for screening.  In the spirit of the open access and open-source nature of Pharmit, users are encouraged to make their submitted libraries publicly accessible, in which case they are available to all users for screening as a user contributed library.  However, registered users have the ability to create a private library, as well as remove or update previously submitted libraries. 

In order to create a library, compounds may be provided in 2D SMILES format, in which case RDKit (\url{rdkit.org}) and the UFF force field \cite{Rappe_1992} are used to generate up to 10 3D conformers for each compound.  This approach has been shown to generate high quality conformations \cite{Ebejer_2012}.  Alternatively, the user may provide compounds in the 3D SDF format, in which case the provided structures are assumed to be valid conformers and are used directly.
